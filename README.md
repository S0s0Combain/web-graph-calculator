# GraphX
A web application for teaching users algorithms for finding shortest paths in graphs, as well as for automating the search for shortest paths.

## Getting started with a project
These instructions will help you run a copy of the project on your local computer for development and testing
purposes. See the "Deployment" section for notes on how to deploy the project on a running system.

### Prerequisites
* Recommended development environment - Visual Studio at least 2019
* Python 3.9
* Advanced knowledge of Python, knowledge of the Bottle framework, html5 and Bootstrap technologies, experience working in Visual Studio
* Windows family operating system

### Installation
* Clone the project repository using Git
* Run the project in Visual Studio
* Install all project dependencies specified in the file requirements.txt
* Check the project settings and file paths

## Project deployment
* Set up a web server
* Configure the project configuration to work with the selected web server
* Run the project on a web server and check its functionality

## Build using Visual Studio
* Check the project using the project build tools in Visual Studio
* Build a project using Visual Studio build tools
* Check the assembled project for operability

## Versioning
GitHub is used for versioning
